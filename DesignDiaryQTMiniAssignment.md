# Design Diary - QT Mini Assignment

I was able to extrapolate upon the given code for the button listeners and the related button functions, but
after that I was feeling lost about how to do the arithmetic operations and clear the screen. After searching the
web for a minute or two, I was able to find a nice tutorial about how to create a calculator using Python. I
thought the tutorial was pretty good, but it was nearly irrelevant since it was using a slightly different library
and the program was structured very differently. The part of the tutorial which helped me the most was the section
about how to evaluate a string as an expression. I used this to evaluate the accumulator's contents as an aritmetic
expression and then return the result to the accumulator object to then display. I also got CLEAR working properly
by simply setting the accumulator to "" when the button is pressed.

I thought this assignment was fun because I finished it surprisingly quickly after the trick to having a string
evaluated as an arithmetic expression.
